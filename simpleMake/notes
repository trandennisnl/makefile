Make commands:
    - make or make all
    - make clean
    - make distclean

Compiler Notes:
-std=c++11          option compiles using c++11 standard
-Wall               option enables all common compiler warnings
-Werror             option enables all warnings to be treated as errors
-Wextra             option enables extra compiler warnings
-Wsign-conversion   option enables warnings for unintentional sign to unsigned conversion warnings
-Weffc++            option enables effective c++ warnings


Makefile Syntax Notes:
VARIABLE = value		Normal setting of a variable - values within it are recursively expanded when the variable is used, not when it's declared
VARIABLE := value		Setting of a variable with simple expansion of the values inside - values within it are expanded at declaration time.
VARIABLE ?= value		Setting of a variable only if it doesn't have a value
VARIABLE += value		Appending the supplied value to the existing value (or setting to that value if the variable didn't exist)
